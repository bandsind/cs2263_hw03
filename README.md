This project help me understand Git, Github, Gradle, javaFX Gitflow and Version control.
## Purpose:
This program will accept and store information about courses offered in six departments: Computer Science, Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and Electrical Engineering
The User can do the following:

1.Enter information about a course by selecting a department name from a combo box (text entry with a dropdown list), typing in the course number, name, number of credits, and then press the enter button. The interface checks that the entries are non-empty (displaying error messages otherwise) and then creates a Course object using the information and stores the object in an appropriate data structure.

2.Ask to list all courses by clicking on a button labeled display (all). All the objects in the data structure are displayed. There is a scrollbar that allows viewing records that cannot be displayed in the given space. Also, note that department codes such as CS and MATH are inserted by the program.

3.Ask to list courses of a given department by clicking on a button labeled display (dept.). Courses for the selected department (via the combo box) in the data structure are displayed.

4.Quit instantly by clicking on the window's 'close' button, or close (after a confirmation dialog) via an 'exit' button within the window.

5.Save the current catalog of courses to a JSON file using the save button.

6.Load a new catalog of courses from a JSON file using the load button.
